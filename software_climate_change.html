			<h1 class="post-title">Software Climate Change</h1>
			<span class="post-date">Tuesday, 17<sup>th</sup> August 2021</span>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				What happens when you look at software environments in the same way we look at the natural world?
			</p>
			<p>
				Hypothesis: There commonality in the problems affecting software and natural environments.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sustainability</li>
				<li>Pollution</li>
				<li>Planning</li>
				<li>Communication</li>
				<li>Infinite Mindset</li>
				<li>Responsibility</li>
				<li>Wait Until Things Calm Down</li>
			</ol>





			<h2>Sustainability</h2>
			<p>
					What happens when you use the available resource in an unsustainable manner?
			</p>
			<p>
				Finite resources - CPU, RAM, disk space, bandwidth.
			</p>
			<p>
				It takes time to find more resources, redistribute and recover.
			</p>






			<h2>Pollution</h2>
			<p>
				Leaving stuff lying around and causing harm.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ocean and beaches - Random shit cluttering up your consoles and file systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rubbish dumps - Abandoned stuff or stuff nobody wants to take responsibility for
			</p>
			<p>
				Nuclear waste - the data you don't want but can't get rid of.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chronic neglect causes toxic waste to multiply / reproduce.
			</p>





			<h2>Planning</h2>
			<p>
				What happens when responsibility for planning and organisation is abdicated?
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Transport systems / networking</li>
				<li>Zoning - residential, retail, commercial, industrial.</li>
			</ul>






			<h2>Communication</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Misinformation - When the user guide doesn't match reality</li>
				<li>Disagreements - Team X vs Team Y</li>
				<li>Reaching the right people</li>
				<li>Making it easy - The code is the documentation - Naming conventions and acronym hell</li>
			</ul>



			<h2>Infinite Mindset</h2>
			<p>
				
			</p>


			<h2>Responsibility</h2>
			<p>
				It's not my problem. Somebody who knows better will fix it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Heroes are a finite resource - chronic neglect makes it hard for successive generations of heroes.
			</p>

			<h2>Wait Until Things Calm Down</h2>
			<p>
There is always something going on that is so urgent that you can't think about the future.
			</p>
			<p>
People often say they'll get to the important thing when the current crisis is over.
			</p>
			<p>
There is always a crisis going on. Always a new disater that's just happened or just about to happen.
			</p>
			<p>
Just as an infinite mindset means you try and make things better in ways that will last forever, it also means you recognise that the world won't wait for you to be ready. You have to prioritise.
			</p>
			<p>
It can be convenient to convince yourself that you are being pragmatic and realistic when you delay something. What you are really doing avoiding an immediate pain at the expense of a drawn out or larger pain later on.
			</p>
			<p>
This is often at the heart of what software engineers call technical debt. A major design flaw can be embarrasig to fix early on but usually not that hard. A major design flaw left untouched for years and lead to mountain of work so costly or technically challenging that it's impossible to get approval to fix. Time to rewrite the entire system from the bottom up?
